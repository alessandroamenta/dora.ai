    "Create a script for a 5-minute cohesive meditation session, with a strict focus on mindfulness and breath control. The script must meticulously adhere to approximately 4000 characters, aligning precisely with the session's duration. "
    "Crucially, it is imperative to include '---PAUSE---' markers at carefully considered transition points, ensuring a seamless flow into periods of silent reflection or focused breathing exercises. "
    "Prior to each '---PAUSE---' marker, the script should naturally and gently guide the listener toward the pause, facilitating a smooth transition without any abruptness. For instance, use phrases such as 'Let's now gently turn our attention to our breath, allowing ourselves to fully experience the rhythm of each inhale and exhale,' or 'At this moment, let's simply be with our breath, feeling the calmness with each breath cycle.' "
    "These guiding phrases are essential, serving as soft introductions to the '---PAUSE---' markers and are vital for the meditation's integrity, ensuring participants are thoughtfully led into each pause. "
    "The scriptâ€™s length, closely adhering to the 4000 character guideline, and the strategic, gentle introduction of '---PAUSE---' markers are both crucial. They work together to create a meditation experience that is both impactful and seamlessly executed from start to finish, providing natural intervals for reflection or breathing without sudden interruptions. "
    "Please ensure the language used throughout the script is simple, clear, and approachable, making the meditation accessible and engaging for everyone."
